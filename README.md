# Colorado Trip Itinerary Site

hosted at: jamesandvalcoloradotrip.netlify.app

Coded with the help of cursor

A clean, professional itinerary for me and my girlfirend's trip

Used cursor, but started getting comfortable with some direct editing of HTML and CSS

Also some good GIT practice for me

Password will be removed after we go, but isn't too hard to hack
